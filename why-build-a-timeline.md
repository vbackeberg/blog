## Why build a timeline?

Me and history class have a tragic relation. It hasn't till this day been my favorite matter to talk about what humans did in the past if it is not for the sake of deciding on my present actions. But, I have always acknowledged that it is important to learn about history.

So, I tried hard to stay on top and get good grades. When we approached the final exams, there was an increasing amount of "raw dates" to be memorized. I struggled to store these facts, decontextualized and inhaled from a list printed on a blank sheet of paper. The end of the story is I dropped to a C grade in history.

## Why I think I failed
I couldn't put them into relation. I couldn't visualize them in front of me.

## An idea to 

(Quote with a date but use wrong date)

So an idea made itself a home in my head: Visualize time to help learners realize sequence of events, time spans and internalize relationships. 

I actually planned to hand this software over to my history teacher one day in an attempt to explain my bad grades.
